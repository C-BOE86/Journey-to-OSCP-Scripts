# OSCP-Scripts

#auto.sh
Sometimes while practicing for the OSCP my VM has problems. Just in case, you're not able to create a snapshot. I created a script that allows me to automatically download the tools I use or if I happen to move another machine I have it ready to go.

#autonmap.py
I attempted to make a automated scanner with nmap using nmap, to see if it would make things easier for the OSCP exam.
