# OSCP-Scripts

#Purpose of these scripts:
I wanted to get a solid grasp of both Python and Bash scripting for the OSCP and beyond. So this is a series of projects to help me get the OSCP. 

#auto.sh
Sometimes while practicing for the OSCP my VM has problems. Just in case, you're not able to create a snapshot. I created a script that allows me to automatically download the tools I use or if I happen to move another machine I have it ready to go.

#autonmap.py
I attempted to make a automated scanner with nmap using nmap, to see if it would make things easier for the OSCP exam. 
To get it to execute, be sure to use "python3 autonmap.py"

#vnp.py
I wanted to practice my python scripting and get better by actually having a small project. I chose to make a choosing OpenVPN script, because I realized that I choose between a few vpns.
